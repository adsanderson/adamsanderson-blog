In this post we will be looking at a process for modelling behaviour in a statechart. In "[Welcome to the world of Statecharts](https://statecharts.github.io/)" some of the downsides of using Statecharts are discussed. One of these downsides is the fact that this is a different way of coding. What follows is a look at a process to help identify states and questions to ask yourself when developing.

## The problem




1. Intro about modelling
2. Define the problem
3. Identify first wave of states
4. Identify actions
5. Group states
6. Think about 0, 1 and n.
