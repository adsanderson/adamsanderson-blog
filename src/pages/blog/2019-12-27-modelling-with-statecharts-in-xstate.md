In this post we will be looking at a process for modelling behaviour in a statechart. The goal of this post is to give you an approach to help ask the questions you need when creating an application and thinking in states, events and transitions.

## The problem




1. Intro about modelling
2. Define the problem
3. Identify first wave of states
4. Identify actions
5. Group states
6. Think about 0, 1 and n.
