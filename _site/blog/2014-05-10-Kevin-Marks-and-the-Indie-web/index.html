This was just the background and foundation to lay out the ideas of the indie web and the future of the web.</p><h3>The bit I found really relevant</h3><p>When Marks was discussing the future of the web one of the points that resonated with me was about building tools that you want to use. I think this idea will colour most of the decisions about how this blog engine is developed (for now). It's easy to go down a rabbit hole of second guessing what other people want in a tool. But while it's just me, I'll stick to a few rules of thumb:</p><ul><li>In the core development, I'm not going to worry too much about breaking what I already have.</li><li>With one big caveat, when I update the the distribution version of the engine that is powering this blog I'm not going to overwrite any theming or content I already have here.</li><li>Going from writing a new post to publishing, I want that to take minimal steps. Ideally one but I've not decided on grunt powered commits.</li></ul><h3>Bonus Feature</h3><p>Here is a follow-up interview with Kevin Marks where he discuss and expands on some of the ideas from his presentation and gives a bit of background on the history of video and the web.</p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/T1kfKV4Yjhs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></article></div><footer><nav><div><div><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7b1630c267230ec687dd7133d3a2e2b3?s=80" class="logo__img" alt="Adam Sanderson"></div>A front-end developer based out of Hastings, UK</div><a href="/">Home<a href="https://github.com/adsanderson" title="Github"> github </a><a href="https://twitter.com/lazydayed" title="Twitter">twitter </a><a href="mailto:adam+site@adamsanderson.co.uk" rel="me">email</a></a></nav></footer><script src="/static/js/alpine.js"></script></body></html>
