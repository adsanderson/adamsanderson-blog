What is Constantine's Equivalence

What is coupling

Why is it a choice!

This seems like a convoluted way of saying the expensive part of making software is when you have to change lots of things. The important part here is understanding that there a choices you can make to direct these costs. 

The problem is these costs aren't directly tied to the outputs. For example, cutting the average time down for a build has a cumulative effect that can be measured over time. Taking a couple of days work to speed the build up by a minute depending on the rate of which diffs are built will add up quickly over time, as every diff and every engineer will benefit.
