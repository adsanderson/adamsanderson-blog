    - heading "The bit I found really relevant" [level=3]
    - paragraph: "When Marks was discussing the future of the web one of the points that resonated with me was about building tools that you want to use. I think this idea will colour most of the decisions about how this blog engine is developed (for now). It’s easy to go down a rabbit hole of second guessing what other people want in a tool. But while it’s just me, I’ll stick to a few rules of thumb:"
    - list:
      - listitem: In the core development, I’m not going to worry too much about breaking what I already have.
      - listitem: With one big caveat, when I update the the distribution version of the engine that is powering this blog I’m not going to overwrite any theming or content I already have here.
      - listitem: Going from writing a new post to publishing, I want that to take minimal steps. Ideally one but I’ve not decided on grunt powered commits.
