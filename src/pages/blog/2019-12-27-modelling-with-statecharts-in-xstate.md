In this post we will be looking at a process for modelling behaviour in a statechart. The goal of this post is to give you an approach to help ask the questions you need when creating an application and thinking in states, events and transitions.

We will start with a simple application, that is reasonably complex, realistic, self contained and has options to grow. We'll identify some requirements and then start the process of modelling the application.

## The problem





1. Intro about modelling
2. Define the problem
3. Identify first wave of states
4. Identify actions
5. Group states
6. Think about 0, 1 and n.
