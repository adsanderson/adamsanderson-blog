Interpretation and assumption

### A beautiful design system

You have your design system. It describes how to layout your application; it gives you a gallery of components to combine together; You have colour schemes, typefaces, icons and graphics; you have defined the voice for your system.

You disseminate your design system for people to create wonderful things. At first wonderful things are created but as the list of creations grows there is something uneasy about what is being created. Things are now almost wonderful, everything looks correct but somehow doesn't quite mesh together in a consistent way.
