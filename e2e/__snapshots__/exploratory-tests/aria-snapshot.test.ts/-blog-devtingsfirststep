      - link "meetup"
      - text: page. There right now is a the first scheduled event for a pre-meetup meetup. It’s in need of a date and location, but to know when and where to schedule it, some members are needed so we can figure it all out.
    - heading "quick hello" [level=3]
    - paragraph: /I did get a surprise after I set-up the group\. I got an email from meetup HQ giving some advice on running successful meetups and then at the end of the email a ‘p[\d,.]+[hmsp]+\.’ just to let me know they’d updated the topics attached to the group\. I checked and saw they’d added ‘tech talks’ and ‘education and technology’ to the list of topics\. Which I thought was excellent \(although maybe a bit ambitious to start off with\)\. They did also mention one fact in the email that meant I had made a small miss-calculation\./

    - paragraph:
      - text: I set the meetup site on a Tuesday. Thinking that it would be sent out to
      - link "meetup.com"
      - text: members right away. This is not the case, they actually wait 4 days before posting it out. So rather than the notice being sent out midweek, it will go out just before the weekend. I do like the window though, gives you an opportunity to get the page set-up fully, while at the same time giving you a ticking clock incentive to get it done.
    - heading "what next" [level=3]
    - paragraph: Hopefully get a few members over the next few days and schedule the pre-meetup. Go down the pub (probably), and see what we can turn Devtings into.
