I went to ffconf 2019 last Friday. As someone who really enjoys conferences and watches plenty of talks on Youtube, it came as a bit of a surprise that this was the first conference I'd been to since 2013. That conference was jQuery UK 2013 and if you want to see some of the fun from there you can go here: [jQuery UK 2013 Vimeo showcase](https://vimeo.com/showcase/2509484)

One of my favourite talks on the day was from Remy about how you may not need jQuery in all your projects.

ffconf 2019 was not a tools, or highly technical, or framework/library specific conference; it was however one of the most forward looking and mature conferences I can think of.
